Utility to fetch your external IP address.

This library is try to act as a replacement of the **ipgetter** library, because that library has disappeared on pypi.org and github.

Why there another ipgetter library?
-----------------------------------------

I found ipgetter disappeared at night of 2019-05-11. I don't know precisely when it's disappeared, and don't know what's going on.

So I write this library with same API interface for my projects that depends on it as a replacement, hope it will help people that ran into  the same situation.
