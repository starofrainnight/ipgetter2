Utility to fetch your external IP address.

This module is designed to fetch your external IP address from the internet.

It is used mostly when behind a NAT.

It picks your IP randomly from a server list to minimize request overhead on a single server

NOTICE: This library is try to act as a replacement of the **ipgetter** library, because that library has disappeared on pypi.org and github.

Why there another ipgetter library?
-----------------------------------------

I found ipgetter disappeared at night of 2019-05-11. I don't know precisely when it's disappeared, and don't know what's going on.

So I write this library with same API interface for my projects that depends on it as a replacement, hope it will help people that ran into  the same situation.

Features
---------

* Correctly detect webpage encoding by chardet
* Control the timeout by library `requests` not by signal alarm (Alarm signal will cause problems)
* Smart server fetch algorithm, the get() method will fetch at least 2 IP with the same value in 3 random servers (return the only one valid IP without checking if there have only one server responsed)
* Support IPv6 either (Return both values if the server provided two of them)

Usage
---------

* ipgetter2 usage

::

    >>> from ipgetter2 import IPGetter
    >>> getter = IPGetter()
    >>> getter.get()
    {v4:"8.8.8.8", v6:"::"}
    >>> getter.get_from("http://checkip.dyndns.org/plain")
    {v4:"8.8.8.8", v6:"::"}
    >>> getter.test()
    Numbers of Servers : 46

    IP's : {v4:"117.117.117.117", v6:"::"} = 26 ocurrencies

* Emulated API interface of ipgetter library

::

    >>> from ipgetter2 import ipgetter1 as ipgetter
    >>> myip = ipgetter.myip()
    >>> myip
    '8.8.8.8'
    >>> ipgetter.IPgetter().test()
    Number of servers: 47
    IP's :
    8.8.8.8 = 47 ocurrencies
